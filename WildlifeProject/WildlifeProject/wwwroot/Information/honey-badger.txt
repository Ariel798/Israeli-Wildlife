Honey badgers, also known as ratels, are related to skunks, otters, ferrets, and other badgers. 
These voracious omnivores get their name from their fondness for feeding on honey and honeybee larvae. 
They also eat insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as roots, bulbs, berries, and fruits.
Though they hunt for their own food most of the time, they’ll happily steal from other carnivores or scavenge the kills of bigger animals when the opportunity arises. 
Their prominent, sharp teeth, long foreclaws, and stocky build allow them to easily rip meat from bone.
